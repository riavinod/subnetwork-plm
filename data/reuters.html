<h1>Reuters Corpora (RCV1, RCV2, TRC2)</h1>

<p>In 2000, Reuters Ltd made available a large collection of Reuters News
stories for use in research and development of natural language
processing, information retrieval, and machine learning systems.  This
corpus, known as "Reuters Corpus, Volume 1" or RCV1, is significantly
larger than the older, well-known Reuters-21578 collection heavily
used in the text classification community.</p>

<p>In Fall of 2004, NIST took over distribution of RCV1 and any future
Reuters Corpora.  You can now get these datasets by sending a request
to NIST and by signing the agreements below.</p>
